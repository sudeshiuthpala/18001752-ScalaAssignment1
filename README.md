# 18001752-ScalaAssignment1
Write Scala functions to solve the following problems. 

You program should upload to gitLab/gitHub repository.

Then submit the repository link to the LMS.



1. The temperature is 35C; convert this temperature into Fahrenheit.

ºF =ºC * 1.8000 + 32.00



2.The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 Pi r3. What is the volume of a sphere with radius 5?



3. Suppose the cover price of a book is Rs. 24.95, but bookstores get a 40% discount. 

Shipping costs Rs. 3 for the first 50 copy and 75 cents for each additional copy. 

What is the total wholesale cost for 60 copies?

Assignment 2

1. Company XYZ & Co. pays all its employees Rs.150 per normal working hour and Rs. 75 per OT hour. A typical employee works 40 (normal) and 20(OT) hours per week has to pay 10% tax. Develop a functional program that determines the take home salary of an employee from the number of working hours and OT hours given.



2.  Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting ticket prices. The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford tickets. In a recent experiment the owner determined a precise relationship between the price of a ticket and average attendance.  At a price of Rs 15.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance. Decreasing the price by  5 Rupees increases attendance by 20 and increasing the price by  5 Rupees decreases attendance by 20. Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased cost. Every performance costs the owner Rs.500. Each attendee costs another 3 Rupees. The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit and ticket price so that he can determine the price at which he can make the highest profit. Implement a functional program to find out the best ticket price.
